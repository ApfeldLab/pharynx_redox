Docker (preferred)
------------------
This is the preferred method of installation. Docker is a (very) lightweight virtual
machine interface. Essentially, it lets you create a "blank" operating system within
your own so you don't have to worry about your personal machine's state interfering
with the requirements of the software (and vice versa).

To get started with Docker, `follow the installation structions on their website for
your operating system <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_.

Once Docker is installed, run the following command to install the pipeline on your
machine::

    $ docker build .
